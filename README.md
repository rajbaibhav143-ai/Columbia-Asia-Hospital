📊 Columbia Asia Hospital Analysis – Power BI Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Columbia Asia Hospital’s operational and patient data to gain insights into hospital performance across departments, services, and patient demographics. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making by identifying trends, inefficiencies, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
The analysis was performed using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard visualization.

🎯 Objectives

* Analyze hospital revenue trends and patient volumes
* Evaluate department-wise and doctor-level performance
* Monitor patient wait times and service efficiency
* Understand patient demographics and service utilization
* Build an interactive dashboard for stakeholders

🗂 Dataset Preparation

Data preparation was performed using Power Query in Power BI:
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Fixed incorrect data types
Standardized demographic fields (age, gender, etc.)
Validated data accuracy before modeling

🧠 Data Modeling & DAX

* Designed a structured data model with proper relationships
* Created key DAX measures for:
* Total Revenue
* Patient Count
* Average Wait Time
* Department-wise KPIs
* Doctor-level performance metrics
* Implemented dynamic filtering using slicers

📈 Dashboard Features

The Power BI report consists of multiple interactive pages, including:
* Revenue Analysis
  Trends over time, department-wise revenue contribution
* Patient Volume Analysis
  Daily/monthly patient inflow and service usage
* Wait Time Metrics
  Average wait time by department and doctor
* Department Performance
  Activity level, efficiency, and workload comparison
* Doctor-Level Analysis
  Patient handling, revenue contribution, and performance insights
